        <img src="./img/1.avif" alt="">
        <p>Star Indian wrestler Bajrang Punia on Friday made an emotional appeal to citizens seeking their support in
            the ongoing protest at Delhi's Jantar Mantar over sexual harassment allegations against Wrestling Federation
            of India (WFI) chief and BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.

            “We fought for the pride of our country. Today we are fighting for the safety and honour of your champions.
            Please support us!”

            Punia's appeal came a day after a large number of people, including farmers from neighbouring states of
            Delhi and DU students, reached Jantar Mantar and expressed solidarity with the wrestlers who are demanding
            the arrest of WFI chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh.</p>

        <h1 class="h3">Ed Sheeran wins copyright case, says ‘will never allow myself to be a piggy bank for anyone to shake’</h1>
        <img src="./img/3.avif" alt="">
        <p>Ed Sheeran's 2014 hit Thinking Out Loud did not unlawfully copy from Marvin Gaye's classic 1973 song Let's
            Get It On, a jury decided on Thursday in a closely watched copyright lawsuit - a verdict that the British
            pop star said would help protect the creative process for song writers in the U.S. and globally. The jury in
            Manhattan federal court determined that heirs of Let's Get It On songwriter Ed Townsend had not proven that
            Sheeran, his label Warner Music Group and his music publisher Sony Music Publishing had infringed their
            copyright interest in the Gaye song. Sheeran hugged his attorneys in the courtroom after the verdict was
            read.

            "It's devastating to be accused of stealing someone else's song when we've put so much work into our
            livelihoods," Sheeran said outside the courthouse following the verdict. "I want to thank the jury for
            making the decision that will help protect the creative process for song writers here in the United States
            and all around the world," Sheeran added.

            The verdict came after six days of trial and less than three hours of jury deliberations. Townsend's heirs
            sued Sheeran for copyright infringement in 2017, contending that Thinking Out Loud copied the "heart" of
            Gaye's song including its melody, harmony and rhythm. Sheeran's attorneys argued that any similarities
            between the songs involve basic musical "building blocks" that cannot be copyrighted.

            The plaintiffs asked for a share of the profits from Thinking Out Loud. The heirs said in a court filing
            that they received 22% of the writer's share of Gaye's song from Townsend.

            "I'm just a guy with a guitar who loves writing music for people to enjoy. I am not and will never allow
            myself to be a piggy bank for anyone to shake," Sheeran said after the verdict.

            PLAYING A CHORD PROGRESSION
            Testifying during the trial, Sheeran denied the copyright infringement claims, telling the jury, "I find it
            really insulting to devote my whole life to being a performer and a songwriter and have someone diminish
            it."

            Sheeran on the witness stand played the chord progression to Thinking Out Loud and sang the opening words:
            "When your legs don't work like they used to." Sheeran testified that his friend and collaborator Amy Wadge
            first started strumming the chords for the song during a visit to his home in England, and that they
            collaborated on the lyrics.

            Ben Crump, a lawyer representing the heirs, told jurors that Sheeran effectively confessed to ripping off
            Gaye's song when he performed it live in concert as a medley with Thinking Out Loud.

            Sheeran testified that singers frequently perform such "mash ups," and that he had on other occasions
            combined his song with Van Morrison's Crazy Love and Dolly Parton's I Will Always Love You.

            Juror Sophia Neis, 23, told reporters afterward that there had been "a lot of back and forth" in the jury
            room before the panel made its decision. Lawyers for Townsend's heirs did not immediately respond to a
            request for comment after the verdict.

            Gaye, who died in 1984, collaborated with Townsend, who died in 2003, to write Let's Get It On, which topped
            the Billboard charts. Sheeran's Thinking Out Loud peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2015.

            Two similar lawsuits are pending against Sheeran in Manhattan, brought by investment banker and Bowie Bonds
            creator David Pullman's Structured Asset Sales LLC, which also owns copyright interests in the Gaye song.

            Pullman said after the verdict that he and his lawyers had learned from the trial. "We'll know what to
            expect," Pullman said.

            Pullman said one of his lawsuits in particular would be different because it involved a copyright on the
            recording of Let's Get It On, rather than just the sheet music. Jurors in that case would be able to hear
            Gaye's original hit, rather than the computerized rendition played in the now-completed trial, Pullman said.

            Sheeran won a trial in London last year in a separate copyright case over his hit Shape of You. Gaye's heirs
            won an important verdict in 2015 when a jury in Los Angeles agreed with the claims that the Robin Thicke and
            Pharrell Williams song Blurred Lines copied Gaye's Got to Give It Up.</p>

        <p>At least eight people were killed and 13 injured in a drive-by shooting near Belgrade late Thursday,
            state-run media reported, a day after nine people were shot dead at an elementary school in the Serbian

            Near Mladenovac on Thursday, an attacker armed with an automatic weapon opened fire from a moving vehicle
            before fleeing, state-run RTS television reported. Police were searching for the attacker.

            A heavy security presence was deployed while helicopters buzzed over the area, according to an AFP
            photographer on the scene.

            Police had blocked the road leading to the villages of Malo Orasje and Dubona.

            Worried relatives gathered outside the emergency medical centre in Belgrade where at least eight injured
            people were hospitalised, N1 television reported.

            Health Minister Danica Grujicic briefly visited the centre.

            Interior Minister Bratislav Gasic called the shooting a "terrorist act", RTS reported.

            The Balkan nation is already reeling from a rare deadly school shooting on Wednesday, when a 13-year-old
            student killed eight peers and a security guard at the Vladislav Ribnikar elementary school in downtown
            Belgrade.

            Another six students and a teacher were wounded in that incident, while health officials said two injured
            remain in critical condition.

            While spring is normally a festive time in Serbia with people flocking outdoors, a three-day mourning period
            will begin on Friday.

            - 'Difficult days' -

            Mass school shootings are extremely rare in Serbia and President Aleksandar Vucic called Wednesday's tragedy
            "one of the most difficult days" in recent history.

            In a national address after the school shooting, Vucic proposed stricter gun control measures, including a
            two-year moratorium on issuing permits for firearms.

            The Interior Ministry has appealed to all firearm owners to keep their guns locked in safes -- warning those
            who do not abide will have their weapons seized.

            The Vladislav Ribnikar elementary school remained sealed off on Thursday, with police guarding the entrance
            to the building.

            Hundreds continued to flock to the school to pay their respects, placing flowers, toys and candles at a
            makeshift memorial.

            People in the Croatian capital Zagreb and the Bosnian Serb administrative capital Banja Luka also lit

            Masses for the victims were held in Belgrade churches while the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church (SPC),
            Patriarch Porfirije, called the shooting a "catastrophe, the likes of which has never happened in our nation
            and our homeland".

        <h1 class="h6">Border ‘generally stable’, China tells India
        </h1>
        <img src="./img/6.avif" alt="">
        <p>China on Thursday pushed the narrative that the boundary situation is “stable” with Chinese foreign minister
            Qin Gang telling his Indian counterpart, S Jaishankar, on the margins of the Shanghai Cooperation
            Organisation (SCO) foreign ministers’ meeting that both sides should work towards maintaining “sustainable
            peace and tranquillity” in the border areas.

            Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang with his Indian counterpart, S Jaishankar. (Twitter)
            Chinese foreign minister Qin Gang with his Indian counterpart, S Jaishankar. (Twitter)
            Qin, according to the Chinese readout on the meeting, said, “…the current situation on the China-India
            border is generally stable.”

            This comes against the backdrop of the failure of the two countries to normalise ties amid the unresolved
            three-year-old military stand-off at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.

            New Delhi has blamed Beijing for violating border agreements and the ongoing standoff. It has repeatedly
            pointed out that resolving the ongoing tension is key to normalising the ties between the two neighbours.

            The Chinese minister, who is also the state councillor, told Jaishankar that the two sides should continue
            to implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, consolidate existing
            achievements, strictly abide by relevant agreements, push for further cooling and easing of the border
            situation and maintain sustainable peace and tranquillity in the border areas.

            In a tweet after the one-hour meeting at a seaside resort in Goa, Jaishankar said the border was the focus
            of the meeting. “A detailed discussion with State Councillor and FM Qin Gang of China on our bilateral
            relationship. Focus remains on resolving outstanding issues and ensuring peace and tranquillity in the
            border areas.” He added they discussed SCO, G20, and BRICS (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa).

            The Chinese statement in Mandarin, which was issued early on Friday, quoted Jaishankar as saying that the
            Indian side “hopes to continue to seek to maintain peace and stability in the border area through
            consultations with the Chinese side.”

            Jaishankar described China-Indian ties as “abnormal” during his talks with Qin in early March on the margins
            of the G20 foreign ministers’ meeting in India.

            The two ministers also discussed the overall state of ties.

            Qin Gang said China and India, as the two most populous developing countries in the world, are both in a
            critical period of modernisation.

            He called China and India “major neighbours” and said the two countries need to “draw lessons from history,
            approach our bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective…”

            He said the two countries should “respect” each other and “embark on a new path of harmonious coexistence,
            peaceful development, and common rejuvenation.”

            “China is ready to work with India to carry out bilateral consultations and exchanges, enhance dialogue and
            cooperation under multilateral frameworks, deepen coordination and cooperation on international and regional
            issues and bring China-India relations back to the track of sound and stable development,” Qin said.

            Besides exchanging views on “international and regional issues of common concerns”, Qin said China supports
            India in hosting a successful SCO summit and hopes that India, as the rotating chair, will play a positive
            role in the success of the summit in the spirit of unity and coordination.

            India and China have been locked in a standoff in the Ladakh sector for three years since May 2020 with both
            sides deploying thousands of troops and heavy armament along the LAC.

            A deadly clash at Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh in June 2020 left 20 Indian soldiers and at least four
            Chinese troops dead – the first fatalities along the LAC since 1975.</p>

            HT has a copy of the FIR.

            Rohit, 31, was also attacked and stabbed by the four assailants – Deepak Dabas alias Titar, Rajesh Bawania
            alias Karambir, Yogesh alias Tunda and Riyaz Khan – who murdered Tajpuria, according to jail officials.

            According to the statement mentioned in the FIR, Tillu rushed to Rohit’s cell soon after he saw his four
            rivals rushing towards him, and asked Rohit to help him close the gate of the cell. The two held the gate
            from inside since there is no latch inside.

            Titar and Tunda tried to open the gate using force. When they could not, they started stabbing Tillu and
            Rohit from outside. Soon, Khan also reached there and told Tillu, “aaj tera kaam hi khatm kar denge (We will
            kill you today)”, the FIR said.

            When Rohit tried to stop the attack, Bawania and Khan threatened to kill him as well if he intervened, the
            document said.

            According to his statement to the police, Rohit said that he was lodged in cell number AC-7 of A-block in
            ward number 5 of the central jail number 8, and Tillu was his neighbour in cell number AC-8.

            “In the B-block (on the first floor) of the same ward lived Deepak Dabas alias Titar, Rajesh Bawania alias
            Karambir, Yogesh alias Tunda and Riyaz Khan, who were allegedly looking for an opportunity to avenge the
            murder of their slain boss Jitender Maan alias Gogi,” Rohit said in his statement.

            On May 2 (Tuesday) around 6 am, the morning counting of prisoners by jail staffers had begun and all inmates
            were in the barracks. Tillu was walking in the corridor while Rohit was inside his cell. Suddenly, Tillu
            came running inside Rohit’s cell and told him to close the gate immediately because they (the four rivals)
            are coming to kill him with knives, the statement mentioned in the FIR said.

            Rohit told the police that he got up and tried to close the gate with Tillu. Tunda and Titar arrived tried
            to push open the gate. As Tillu and Rohit did not lose their grip, Titar and Tunda started stabbing them.
            Their two associates – Bawania and Khan – arrived there with knives, threatened Rohit to step aside and
            stabbed him in his hands to force open the gate, the FIR said.

            “The four inmates barged into the cell, stabbed Tillu, and dragged him outside, where they incessantly
            attacked him with knives. When Tillu tried to save himself, Tunda pinned him down on the floor and asked
            Titar and Khan to finish him. Titar, Khan and Tunda repeatedly stabbed Tillu in his neck, chest and abdomen.
            Some inmates and I tried to save Tillu, but Bawania pointed knives at us and threatened to kill us. After
            some time, the jail staff arrived and removed them with difficulty,” Rohit has said in the statement.

            Tillu and Rohit were rushed to Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) hospital after preliminary medical attention at the
            hospital’s dispensary. Tillu succumbed to his nearly 150 stab wounds at the hospital. Rohit was sent back to
            the jail after medical attention.

            According to a jail official, there are eight cells on the ground floor, where Tillu and Rohit were lodged.
            None of the cells can be latched or locked from inside. Also, there was no iron grill installed on the
            ground floor, unlike the first floor, to separate the two levels.</p>

            The SMC election was also the first test for chief minister (CM) Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu’s popularity after
            he was chosen to lead the state nearly five months ago, one that he passed with flying colours.

            While BJP lost the plot amid infighting and ticket distribution, the result is the reflection of support the
            Congress-led state government received from government employees.

            BJP had replaced its state party chief Suresh Kashyap with Rajeev Bindal amid electioneering. The party
            contested the MC elections under the leadership of Suresh Kashyap, with party bigwigs also campaigning in
            the capital. Information and broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur held road shows, while former chief
            minister Jai Ram Thakur himself held meetings across different wards only for it all to come to a nought.

            Women steal the show

            Women candidates outshone their male counterparts, winning as many 21 of the 34 wards. Among the
            heavyweights, the former mayor and BJP candidate Satya Kaundal lost from Sanjauli ward to Congress’ Mamata
            Chandel by a margin of 196 votes.

            Among the heavyweights, the former mayor and BJP candidate Satya Kaundal lost from Sanjauli ward to
            Congress’ Mamata Chandel by a margin of 196 votes. Another former mayor Sohan Lal, who rebelled against
            Congress and contested as an independent, lost from Krishnanagar ward. Congress’ Shimla (Urban) block
            president, meanwhile, lost from Bharari Ward.

            The polling for SMC was held on May 2 after being delayed by one year due to a petition in the High Court
            challenging the delimitation of wards.

            The previous BJP government had increased the number of wards in SMC from 34 to 41, a decision that was
            overturned by Congress after coming to power in the state paving way for the civic body elections.

            In the 2017 elections, the BJP won the SMC for the first time, since 1986 when the first election to the
            Civic body was held. The saffron party had won 17 out of 34 seats and formed the Municipal Corporation.

            The CPI (M) had won the mayor and deputy mayor’s posts in 2012 in the first and only direct election to the
            top posts.

            Dubbing it a “historic” win, Sukhu said, “Congress won 24 seats for the first time in municipal corporation.
            It’s a mandate for the state’s governance. The outcome is sure to have a bearing on the future elections
            since the polls were held on the party symbols.”

            Conceding defeat, former CM Jai Ram said, “BJP accepts and respects the mandate given by the people of the
            capital town.” He, however, was quick to allege misuse of official machinery.

            Delighted over the Congress’ spectacular victory in Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC) the state party chief
            Pratibha Singh expressed gratitude to the voters for reposing faith in the Grand Old Party.

            Crediting the victory to the party workers, Pratibha said she was grateful to them for thededication and
            sincerity with which they have performed their duties. She also expressed gratitude to all the party leaders
            including AICC Himachal in-charge Rajeev Shukla, co-incharge Tajendra Pal Singh Bittu, chief minister (CM)
            Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu and deputy chief minister Mukesh Agnihotri for leading the party to a victory in the
            civic body polls.

            “The hard work of workers after winning the assembly elections has paid off and the Congress party has
            registered a victory in SMC and by-election to Palampur Municipal Corporation,” she said.

            Sukhu said the mandate was also a stamp of approval on the pro-people decision taken by the Congress
            government.

            “This victory comes with a huge responsibility,” he said, adding that good administration is necessary for
            good governance. “The government is finding out new resources and in the next four years the e</p>

        </h1>

        <p>Going on a trek can be an immensely enjoyable and fulfilling experience where the chance to escape from the
            hustle and bustle of everyday life and immerse oneself in nature is a much-needed respite. Trekking offers
            the opportunity to explore breathtakingly beautiful landscapes and challenge oneself both physically and
            mentally.

            You may also encounter like-minded individuals who share your love of adventure and the great outdoors and
            form long-lasting friendships. In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Aditya Gupta, Everester and TEDx speaker,
            shared, “The sense of accomplishment and satisfaction upon reaching your destination strengthens our
            personality. Trekking allows you to disconnect from the digital world and connect with yourself and the
            natural world.”

            Before going on a trek, he recommended that it is important to be mindful of the following preparations -

            1. Physical preparation: It is essential to be physically fit and in good health before going on a difficult
            trek. Regular exercises, such as cardio, strength training, and endurance workouts, can help build stamina
            and endurance. A simple conditioning tool available to everyone is the staircase! Climbing the equivalent of
            50-100 stories everyday (build it up over a few days) can go a long way in making the trek a breeze for you.

            2. Mental conditioning: Going on a difficult trek can be challenging, so it is important to be mentally
            prepared for the journey. Mental preparation includes being positive, having a flexible mindset and knowing
            what to expect. Charles Darwin has said famously, “Attitude creates the difference between an adventure and
            an ordeal.” So treks could become an ordeal without the right mindset.

            3. Selection of route and guide: Before embarking on a trek, it is important to research and select a
            suitable route and a knowledgeable guide. Choose a route that matches your experience level and fitness and
            be sure to gather information about the trail, terrain, and weather conditions. The guide should have
            extensive knowledge of the area and experience in leading treks.

            4. The right equipment: It is important to invest in good quality trekking equipment, such as a backpack,
            tent, sleeping bag, and trekking poles. Ensure that the equipment is lightweight, waterproof and comfortable
            to use. Additionally, carry essential items like a water bottle, headlamp, and a multi-tool.</p>
